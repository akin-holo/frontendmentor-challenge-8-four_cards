## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt more about **Flex layout**. I discovered that *flex property* can give layout as much as Grid. 

I get to understand _align-self, order_ etc.

For instance, see below:

```css
.parent-element {
  display: flex;
}
.child-element {
  align-self: baseline;
  order: 3;
}
```



### Continued development

While I still want to get better understanding of ***flex layout***, I absolutely do not understance **Grid layout**. These are what I will be working on



### Useful resources

- [Wes Bos flex tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=wes+bos+flexbox) - This helped me top know more about flexbox and its layout. I really liked it and I will be using it going forward.
